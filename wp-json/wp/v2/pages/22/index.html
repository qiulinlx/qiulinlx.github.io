I am a research-driven Applied Mathematics Honours Graduate with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. I have always been interested in how technology can be used to good. In particular, I&#8217;m keen to explore how AI can be applied in various fields, particularly in combating climate change and improving the lives of others. My enthusiasm for simplifying complex concepts through tutoring reflects my commitment to education as a powerful tool for empowering individuals. Beyond academics, you can either find me in the ocean, the mountain or curled up with a good book.
